# AIT - Artificial Information Technology
Instant Tech Support for Anyone

## Purpose

AIT aims to revolutionize tech support by providing an AI-powered tool that can either automatically perform computer tasks or guide users through them step-by-step. It consists of a standalone desktop application and an optional Raspberry Pi-based USB companion device.

## Overview

The core tool offers two modes:

*   **Action Mode:** Describe a computer problem or task (e.g., "change my wallpaper," "my browser is slow after updates"), and the AI will attempt to resolve it automatically. *Note: This mode is experimental and may have a lower success rate.*
*   **Walkthrough Mode:** Receive clear, step-by-step instructions generated by the AI to perform the task yourself. This mode generally has a higher success rate but requires more user interaction.

## Installation

### Desktop App (Mac, Windows, Linux)

1.  **Download:** Obtain the latest release for your operating system from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/your-username/AIT/releases) (Link TBD).
2.  **Mac:**
    *   Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
    *   Drag the `AIT` application icon into your `Applications` folder.
    *   You may need to grant permissions on first launch (System Settings > Privacy & Security).
3.  **Windows:**
    *   Run the downloaded `.exe` or `.msi` installer.
    *   Follow the on-screen prompts.
4.  **Linux:**
    *   **AppImage:**
        *   Make the downloaded `.AppImage` file executable: `chmod +x AIT-*.AppImage`
        *   Run the AppImage: `./AIT-*.AppImage`
    *   **Debian/Ubuntu (`.deb`):**
        *   Install using: `sudo dpkg -i AIT-*.deb`
        *   If dependencies are missing, run: `sudo apt --fix-broken install`
    *   **(Other formats TBD)**

### USB Companion (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W)

This setup involves flashing a standard Raspberry Pi OS image and then running a setup script.

1.  **Hardware:**
    *   Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
    *   Micro SD Card (8GB or larger recommended, Class 10+)
    *   USB Stem or appropriate USB-A adapter for the Pi Zero's OTG port.
    *   Computer for flashing the SD card.
    *   (Optional but Recommended) Way to connect to the Pi for initial setup (e.g., monitor+keyboard, SSH over WiFi/Ethernet).
2.  **Flash Raspberry Pi OS:**
    *   Download the latest **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (recommended for performance) or Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop from the official [Raspberry Pi Software page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
    *   Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or another tool like [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the OS image onto your Micro SD card.
    *   **Before Ejecting (Optional but Recommended):** Use the Imager's settings (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X) or manually create files on the `/boot` partition to:
        *   Enable SSH (create an empty file named `ssh`).
        *   Pre-configure WiFi (create a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file with your network details). This allows the Pi to connect to the internet for the setup script.
3.  **First Boot & Connect:**
    *   Insert the SD card into the Pi Zero 2 W.
    *   Boot the Pi. Connect to it via SSH or monitor/keyboard. Ensure it has internet access.
4.  **Download/Clone Repository:**
    *   On the Raspberry Pi, clone this repository:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git # Install git if needed
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIT.git # Replace with your repo URL
        cd AIT/Companion
        ```
5.  **Run Setup Script:**
    *   Execute the setup script using sudo:
        ```bash
        sudo bash setup.sh
        ```
    *   The script will install dependencies, configure USB OTG mode, copy necessary files, and set up the autorun service.
6.  **Reboot:** Once the script completes successfully, reboot the Raspberry Pi:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```
7.  **Connect:** After rebooting, plug the assembled USB Companion (Pi Zero + USB Stem/Adapter) into a USB port on your host computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

## Usage Guide

1.  **Launch:**
    *   **Desktop App:** Run the installed AIT application.
    *   **USB Companion:** Plug the device into your computer. The AIT application should launch automatically after a few moments as the Pi boots and detects the host OS.
2.  **API Keys:**
    *   On first launch, or via the Settings menu, you will be prompted to enter API keys for the AI services you wish to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, OpenRouter).
    *   These keys are stored locally and securely on your machine.
3.  **Select Mode:** Choose either "Action Mode" or "Walkthrough Mode".
4.  **Enter Task:** Type your computer problem or the task you want help with into the input field.
5.  **Receive Assistance:**
    *   **Action Mode:** The AI will attempt the task. Monitor its progress. You may be prompted for confirmation for certain steps.
    *   **Walkthrough Mode:** Follow the step-by-step instructions provided.
6.  **Safety (USB Companion):** To immediately stop any action being performed by the AI when using the USB Companion, simply unplug the device from your computer.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
